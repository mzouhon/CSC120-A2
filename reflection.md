What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was easily able to figure out what attributes I wanted in each class and that allowed me to figure out what methods would be best in each class. While I was able to plan out my code and execute it without too many issues, I often found myself struggling with Python syntax such as indentation, lack of semicolons, and the use of "self" in methods to ensure that the system knew that the method was in reference to the instance calling it. Some advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to start by planning out code using comments, especially if they are unfamiliar with the syntax of the language they are using. This allows for the individual to have a simple outline of the code and be able to easily pinpoint what things they may not know how to execute in Python and focus on that first.
